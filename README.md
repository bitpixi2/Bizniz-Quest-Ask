# BiznizQuest - Create your networking ask

## What is BiznizQuest?

Bizniz Quest is an interactive Reddit app that transforms professional networking into an engaging quest-based experience. Think of it as a "job board meets RPG" where users create "asks" (job requests, collaboration opportunities, or service needs) that get posted to r/Bizniz Quest with automatic flair assignment and physical swag rewards for sharing stories of successful connections. The aesthetic draws inspiration from "office-core" culture, blending corporate humor of The Office, dystopian workplace themes of Severance, and the professional networking vibe of LinkedIn. The color palette features warm, nostalgic office tones: brown, beige, and manila folder colors that evoke classic corporate environments.

**üåê Landing Page**: Visit [https://bizniz.quest](https://bizniz.quest) for the official Bizniz Quest office hub, which will feature various Bizniz Quest apps built on Reddit Devvit system, and show off winnable sticker swag (and maybe future purchasable clothing, with only approved designs)!
